# SpookyScene
Project done using OpenGL.

This project was tested in Windows 10 (64-Bit) running VS 2013.
The project was constructed as a Win32 Console Application in Visual Studio.

To use:

	1) double-click on the "VC++ Project" file
	
	2) allow VS 2013 to open
	
	3) hit F5 to build and run
  
The files are a disorganized mess because I originally programmed it in Mac OSX and had to quickly port the project due to a deadline. Not pretty but works!
